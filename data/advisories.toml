#TODO: work out how to add a data dir to any repo that has documentation
# atm, repo's have a docs dir that is akin to the hugo content dir.


# Define Advisory texts
# can be used in page frontmatter:
#       advisory = "experimental"

[texts]
experimental = "The functionality described on this page is marked as Experimental, and as such, may change before it becomes generally available."
rc = "The Swarm mode feature included in Docker Engine 1.12 is a release candidate feature and might be subject to non backward-compatible changes. Some functionality may change before the feature becomes generally available."
docker4mac-beta = "Docker for Mac is currently in public beta. Some functionality may change before the product becomes generally available."
docker4win-beta = "Docker for Windows is currently in public beta. Some functionality may change before the product becomes generally available."

swarm = "See [Swarm mode overview](/engine/swarm/) for the orchestration features introduced in Docker Engine 1.12. Only refer to the Docker Swarm documents below for information on the standalone Swarm product."

engine = "This site contains documentation for the v1.12 release candidate version of Docker Engine. For the Docker Engine v1.11 docs, see [https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/). Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows are currently in Beta."


# URL based advisories
# any URL that begins with "/engine/" will get the "engine" advisory
# will be over-ridden by the `advisory` frontmatter in the topic
# [paths]
# "/engine/" = "engine"
# "/swarm/" = "swarm"
